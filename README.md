This is just a hack for now, but the goal is to have an implementation of a Deep Belief Network in Julia. We are using the Restricted Boltzmann Machine implementation from [Boltzmann.jl](https://github.com/dfdx/Boltzmann.jl) and a HDF5 data source based on an implementation in [Mocha.jl](https://github.com/pluskid/Mocha.jl). We may either replace the latter with a simpler HDF5 source implementation or implement a training algorithm in a way that's more compatible with Mocha.
